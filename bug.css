The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly to calculate the width of an element based on viewport width and another element's width.  The expression `calc(50vw - #elementId.width)` is invalid because you can't directly subtract the `width` property of another element within a `calc()` expression. The `width` property returns a string, and the `calc()` function expects numerical values.
