This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `calc()` function in CSS to perform calculations involving the width of another element.  The example shows the incorrect usage and the corrected solution.  The `bug.css` file contains the incorrect code, and the `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected implementation using JavaScript to get the element's width and perform the calculation.
